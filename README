This package will, in time, provide a complete suite of functionality for editing OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) code in Vim.

Provided functionality includes:
- syntax highlighting
- automatic indentation
- file type plug-in, setting options such as formatoptions and foldmethod, among others.

More features will follow, such as (but not necessarily limited to) code completion.

I've tested this using Vim 7.4. It should work on some earlier versions, though.

For complete documentation, type ":help glsl" in Vim after installing the plug-in.

The project is hosted at https://github.com/brobeson/glslVim. If you discover a bug, or want to request a feature, please create an issue at https://github.com/brobeson/glslVim/issues.
